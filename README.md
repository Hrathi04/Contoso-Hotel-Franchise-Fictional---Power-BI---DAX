# Contoso-Hotel-Franchise-Fictional---Power-BI---DAX
Analyzed hotel reservation data for Contoso to support executive decision-making and revenue growth. Built a star-schema data model and interactive Power BI dashboards with advanced DAX to uncover customer segments, revenue trends, and growth opportunities, delivering clear, actionable insights.

**S** - Contoso, a major hotel franchisor in Hawaii, needed timely business insights to support executive decision-making and drive revenue growth. 

**T** - Our team was engaged to analyze customer reservation data and deliver a clear, interactive visual report that would empower executives to identify trends, segment customers, and optimize business strategies.

**A** - After preprocessing data, using Power BI, we modeled the data in a star schema and developed interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics such as customer segmentation, sales per reservation, return rates, and revenue by region, age group, and interest. Advanced DAX calculations were implemented for custom KPIs, and we performed trend and comparative analysis to highlight underperforming segments and growth opportunities. Findings and recommendations were communicated through a concise executive presentation.

**R** - Our group delivered a well-structured presentation, providing critical insights and directly addressing Contoso’s business challenges with actionable, data-driven solutions. The project demonstrated our ability to communicate complex analytics clearly and offer practical recommendations tailored to executive needs.
